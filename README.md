# Testing
## From the ReactReduxStarterKit [README](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit#testing):
  >    To add a unit test, simply create a .spec.js file anywhere in ~/tests.
  >    **Karma** will pick up on these files automatically,
  >      and **Mocha** and **Chai** will be available within your test 
  >      without the need to import them.
  >    Coverage reports will be compiled to ~/coverage by default.
  >    If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, 
  >      you can do so by modifying coverage_reporters in ~/config/project.config.js.
